Demanded Paged Memory : Formula for Maximum Paged Fault  And Multilevel Queue Scheduling
P1:
Ques. 10. Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of  pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2.  Consider the following set of processes (for reference)with their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.
-------------------------------------
Process  Arrival-Time   Burst-Time

P1             0      	       5
P2             1             	 3
P3             2               3
P4             4               1

P2:
Ques. 21. Consider a scenario of demand paged memory. Page table is held in registers. It takes 8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replaced page is not modified and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100 nanoseconds. Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time. Generate a solution to find maximum acceptable page-fault rate for access time that is not more than 200 nanoseconds.
